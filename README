Installation:

FeOSMusic requires the soundStream lib for FeOS. You can find it here:

https://github.com/Tomwi/soundStream

steps:
1) place soundStream in $(FEOSSDK)/userlib/
2) Compile soundStream ('make install')
3) Compile FeOSMusic   ('make install')

NOTE:
- The b0rklter sounds horrible, if you want to try it, adjust your volume (low!!)
- Filters only work on 16bit files atm
- all the codec config files should go into /data/FeOSMusic/cfg/
